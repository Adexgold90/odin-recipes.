    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Prep & season potato</h3>
            <p>Preheat oven to 450°F with a rack in the upper third. Place a rimmed baking sheet on upper oven rack to preheat. Scrub potato, then cut lengthwise into ¼-inch thick fries. In a large bowl, toss potatoes, 2 teaspoons oil, 1 teaspoon chorizo chili spice blend, and season with salt and pepper.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Roast oven fries</h3>
            <p>Transfer seasoned potatoes to preheated baking sheet, spreading into a single layer. Roast on upper oven rack until potatoes are tender and browned, about 16–18 minutes. Meanwhile, finely chop cilantro leaves and stems. Once fries are done roasting, reduce oven to 200°F. Directly on baking sheet, carefully toss fries with cilantro. Return to oven to keep warm until step 6.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Prep dressing</h3>
            <p>Squeeze 1 tablespoon lime juice into a medium bowl. Cut any remaining lime into wedges. Finely chop 2 teaspoons garlic and add to bowl with lime juice. Whisk in 2 tablespoons oil, ½ teaspoon sugar, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Transfer 1½ tablespoons dressing to a large bowl; reserve for step 6. Reserve remaining dressing in medium bowl for step 5.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Cook chicken</h3>
            <p>Heat 2 teaspoons oil in a medium heavy skillet (preferably cast-iron) over medium-high. Pat chicken dry and pound to an even ¼-inch thickness, if desired; season all over with salt and pepper. Add chicken and cook until lightly browned and cooked through, 3–4 minutes per side.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Marinate cooked chicken</h3>
            <p>Transfer chicken to medium bowl with lime-garlic dressing. Let rest for 5 minutes, turning occasionally.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Make salad & serve</h3>
            <p>Add spinach to reserved lime-garlic dressing in large bowl, and toss gently to coat. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Transfer chicken to plates, spooning some of the marinade over top. Serve chicken with salad and oven fries alongside. Pass any lime wedges at the table for squeezing over. Enjoy!</p>
