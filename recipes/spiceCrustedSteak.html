    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Prep ingredients</h3>

<p>Thinly slice onion into rings; finely chop 1 tablespoon of the onion rings. Quarter cucumber lengthwise (peel first, if desired), then cut crosswise into ¼-inch pieces. Coarsely chop roasted red peppers. Halve lettuce lengthwise, then cut into ½-inch pieces; discarding end. Place ¼ cup flour in a medium bowl; season generously with salt and pepper.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Marinate vegetables</h3>
            <p>In a large bowl, whisk to combine 2 tablespoons oil, 1 tablespoon vinegar, and a pinch each of salt and pepper. Add cucumbers, peppers, and chopped onions, stirring to combine. Set aside to marinate until step 6.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Prepare coriander rub</h3>
            <p>In a small bowl, stir to combine coriander and ½ teaspoon each of salt and pepper. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Cook steaks</h3>
            <p>Pat steaks dry, then season all over with coriander rub. Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a medium skillet over medium-high. Add steaks and cook, until well browned and medium-rare, 2–3 minutes per side (or longer for desired doneness). (Reduce heat to medium if steaks are browning too quickly). Transfer to a cutting board to rest.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Fry onions</h3>
            <p>Heat ¼-inch oil in a large skillet over medium-high until shimmering (oil should sizzle vigorously when a pinch of flour is added). Add sliced onions to flour mixture, breaking up rings. Working in batches, add onions to skillet and fry, stirring, until golden-brown and crisp, 2–3 minutes per batch. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and season with salt.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Finish & serve</h3>
            <p>Crumble feta into marinated vegetables, then add lettuce and toss to combine. Thinly slice steaks, if desired. Serve chopped salad topped with coriander steak and frizzled onions. Enjoy!</p>
