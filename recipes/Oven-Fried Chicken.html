    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Prep ingredients</h3>
            <p>Preheat oven to 425°F with a rack in the top position. Finely grate all of the lemon zest, then separately squeeze 1½ tablespoons lemon juice into a small bowl. Finely grate Parmesan. Lightly oil a rimmed baking sheet.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Prep chicken</h3>
            <p>Pat chicken dry, then, using a meat mallet or heavy skillet, pound each to an even ½-inch thickness. Season lightly with salt and pepper. In a small bowl, stir to combine mayonnaise, lemon zest, and all of the jerk spice. Transfer half of the spiced mayonnaise to a large bowl and reserve for step 5. Spread remaining spiced mayonnaise over top of each chicken breast.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Prep salad</h3>
            <p>Cut apple into quarters, then core and thinly slice fruit. Transfer walnuts to a sheet of foil, and toss with ½ teaspoon oil. Toast walnuts on top oven rack until golden, 4–5 minutes (watch closely as ovens vary). Sprinkle with salt. Remove any wilted lettuce leaves, then tear lettuce into bite-size pieces; discard stem end.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Cook chicken</h3>
            <p>On a plate, toss ¼ cup panko with 1 tablespoon oil and half of the Parmesan. Dip mayo side of each chicken breast into panko, pressing to adhere. Transfer to prepared baking sheet, panko side up. Bake chicken on top oven rack until cooked through, about 10 minutes. Remove from oven; switch oven to broil. Broil until topping is golden and crispy, 1–2 minutes (watch closely).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Make salad</h3>
            <p>To the large bowl with reserved spiced mayonnaise; whisk in lemon juice and 1½ tablespoons oil; season with a pinch each of sugar, salt, and pepper. Add lettuce, apples, walnuts, and remaining Parmesan; toss to combine.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Finish & serve</h3>
            <p>Transfer chicken to a cutting board and slice, if desired. Serve oven-fried chicken with apple-walnut salad alongside. Enjoy!</p>
